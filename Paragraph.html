        <h1>Air pollution
        </h1>

        <p>Air pollution means the air being polluted. Air is the most important element of the environment. Human and Animal beings cannot live a single moment without air. But the air is being polluted day by day. There are many reasons for air pollution. Firstly, the smoke of mills and factories is responsible for air pollution. Secondly, the burning of fossil fuels by mills and factories, Brickfields, railway engines and powerhouses is also responsible for it. Thirdly, melting tar and pitch for road construction causes air pollution. Besides, burning wood and motor vehicles also creates smoke. There are many bad impacts of air pollution. More smoke means more carbon-di-oxide which causes global warming and a bad impact on the environment. Weâ€™ll be sick by inhaling polluted air. It causes heart problems along with cancer. Children in air polluted areas commonly suffer from pneumonia and asthma. The problem is going out of control day by day. We cannot solve the problem fully, but we should find the way to minimize air pollution. The government must come forward to minimize the problem. We should increase public awareness regarding this. Mass media can help in raising public awareness.
